HackBio Stage One Task


This repository contains the first stage of a Python-based bioinformatics learning toolkit. It provides essential functions that reflect real genomics and computational biology workflows, including DNA translation, Hamming distance calculation, and support for loading and visualizing biological datasets.

## 🚀 Features

### ✔ DNA → Protein Translation
- Supports codon-based translation  
- Handles unknown codons gracefully (configurable)  
- Modular and extensible design  
- Ready for FASTA/CSV input integration

### ✔ Hamming Distance Calculation
- Works for any pair of equal-length strings  
- Provides mismatch counts and positions  
- Useful for mutation scanning and QC checks  
- Includes padding/validation options

### ✔ Data Analysis Infrastructure
The project follows standard bioinformatics expectations:
- `pandas` for dataframe operations  
- `numpy` for numerical work  
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` for plotting  
- Heatmaps, scatterplots, KDE plots, correlations
